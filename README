A cool javascript interpreter that embeds Tracemonkey.

You need the nspr library installed (libnspr4.so) [Probably if you have firefox you have that lib]
You also need the readline library with headers (it's a GNU standard)
And finally you need autoconf 2.13, just install it.

To compile the project do:

cd js
./compile.sh
sudo ./install.sh
cd ..
make
sudo make install
